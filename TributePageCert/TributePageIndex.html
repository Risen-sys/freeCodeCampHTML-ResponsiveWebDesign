        <div id="tribute-info">Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – 13 June 1645), also known as Shinmen Takezō, 
            Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku,was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin, who became renowned through 
            stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels</div>
        <div id="tribute-info2">He was the founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of swordsmanship, 
            and in his final years authored The Book of Five Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (獨行道, The Path of Aloneness).</div>   
        <div id="Birth-Head">Birth of a Warrior</div>
        <div id="Birth-info"> Musashi himself simply states in The Book of Five Rings that he was born in Harima Province. Musashi no Kami was a court title,
             making him the nominal governor of Musashi Province. "Fujiwara" was the lineage from which Musashi claimed descent.</div>
